    "However, this niche seems to show some potential. One thing we could do is take another popular book and turn it into an app where we could add different features besides the raw version of the book. This might include daily quotes from the book, an audio version of the book, quizzes about the book, etc. On top of that, we could also embed a dictionary within the app, so users don't need to exit our app to look up words in an external app.\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea seems to fit well with the fact that the App Store is dominated by for-fun apps. This suggests the market might be a bit saturated with for-fun apps, which means a practical app might have more of a chance to stand out among the huge number of apps on the App Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other genres that seem popular include weather, book, food and drink, or finance. The book genre seem to overlap a bit with the app idea we described above, but the other genres don't seem too interesting to us:\n",
    "\n",
    "Weather apps — people generally don't spend too much time in-app, and the chances of making profit from in-app adds are low. Also, getting reliable live weather data may require us to connect our apps to non-free APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Food and drink — examples here include Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts, McDonald's, etc. So making a popular food and drink app requires actual cooking and a delivery service, which is outside the scope of our company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finance apps — these apps involve banking, paying bills, money transfer, etc. Building a finance app requires domain knowledge, and we don't want to hire a finance expert just to build an app.\n",
